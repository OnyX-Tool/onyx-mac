## 📖 Why OnyX Stands Out
**OnyX** is one of the oldest and most reliable maintenance tools for macOS.  
Unlike commercial “cleaners”, OnyX is completely **free**, **safe**, and **developed natively for macOS**.  

Its clear interface and transparent processes make it ideal for power users who prefer control over automated “optimization suites”.  
Every function OnyX performs is reversible and well-documented — nothing is hidden, nothing is risky.
